    <h1>JAMStack Cohort 3 - Discology</h1>
    <h2 Week2 - Session 3 - Semantics and Accessibility </h2>
    
    <h2>What I did</h2>
    <h3>25 Jan</h3>
    <p> Set up the repository, played a bit with VS Code and GitIT, downloaded the assets and set up placeholder files for the course work.
    <h3>26 Jan - Turns out we got a night off</h3>
    
    excellent you mean apart from think I'm clever truying to reuse earlier earlier repositorys to save 'space' and then spend an age realising prehaps I should have followed the steps
    <p> so at this point I'nm still not done with my CSS, I could cheat and just crib it all from others code but wheres the fun in that when I'm suppose to be learning. </p>
    RETRO
    <h3> What went well</h3>following the steps is goood , especially for a pain free life,  but actually getting a litttle lost helps you appreciate your finished product when you final see the light.
    It made me go back and reuse the cmd console rather than build directly in GitHub.
    <h3> What went well</h3>
    <h3>Chnages for next time</h3>
